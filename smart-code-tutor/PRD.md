# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Title
**Smart Code Tutor: Real-Time Code Interpreter with RAG Explanations**

---

## 1. Overview

Build a full-stack web application that allows users to write and execute Python or JavaScript code in a browser-based editor, receive real-time streamed outputs, and get intelligent, context-aware explanations powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The system will use secure sandboxed execution, a vector database for documentation retrieval, and a state-of-the-art LLM for explanations.

---

## 2. Goals & Objectives

- **Interactive Coding:** Users can write, edit, and execute code in Python or JavaScript.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Output and explanations are streamed live as code runs.
- **Intelligent Explanations:** RAG pipeline provides step-by-step, context-aware explanations and error solutions.
- **Security:** All code runs in isolated sandboxes (E2B) to prevent abuse.
- **Scalability:** System supports multiple concurrent users and executions.
- **Extensibility:** Modular design for easy addition of languages, models, or features.

---

## 3. Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Monaco Editor
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python) with WebSocket support
- **Vector Database:** Pinecone (via langchain-pinecone)
- **Embeddings:** Nomic (via langchain-nomic)
- **RAG/LLM:** Groq (via langchain-groq)
- **Sandboxed Execution:** E2B
- **LangChain Community:** For orchestration and integration

---

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1. Frontend

- Monaco Editor with syntax highlighting and language selection (Python/JavaScript)
- "Run" button to submit code
- Real-time output and explanation display (WebSocket streaming)
- Chat-like interface for explanations and guidance
- Error highlighting and suggestions

### 4.2. Backend

- FastAPI server with WebSocket endpoints for:
  - Code submission and execution
  - Streaming output and explanations
- Integration with E2B for secure, sandboxed code execution (Python/JS)
- RAG pipeline:
  - Embed documentation and best practices using Nomic
  - Store/retrieve embeddings in Pinecone
  - Use Groq LLM to generate explanations based on retrieved docs and execution context
- Concurrency handling (async/await)
- Rate limiting and resource monitoring

### 4.3. Security

- All code runs in isolated sandboxes (E2B)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

### 4.4. Documentation & Testing

- API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Unit and integration tests for core components
- Usage and setup documentation

---

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Low-latency streaming, supports multiple concurrent users
- **Reliability:** Handles errors gracefully, recovers from failures
- **Scalability:** Easily deployable and horizontally scalable
- **Maintainability:** Modular, well-documented codebase
