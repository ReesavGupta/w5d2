### 7. Out of Scope
- No user authentication or portfolio management in v1
- No paid data APIs
- No mobile app (web only)

---

### 8. Assumptions & Risks
- Free API rate limits may restrict update frequency
- SSE/EventSource may not be supported in all browsers
- LLM costs and latency depend on provider
- Pinecone and Nomic embedding usage within free/affordable tier

---

### 9. Open Issues
- Finalize LLM provider and model
- Monitor API rate limits and optimize fetch intervals
- UI/UX refinements based on user feedback

---

### 10. Success Metrics
- Sub-second chat and data response times
- 99% uptime
- High engagement (messages/user/day)
- Positive user feedback on recommendations and usability

---

### 11. Task List (with Progress Tracking)
